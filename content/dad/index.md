<br>

My dad was the most kind and generous person I've ever known. I'm not just saying that, I've never met someone with his kindness, empathy, and generosity. He was always willing to help anyone in need, no matter the situation.

<br> 

He taught me [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) when I was a kid, and that sparked my lifelong interest in computers and programming. He was always supportive of my interests and encouraged me to pursue my passions.

<br>

When I was growing up, there were always two things that were guaranteed to be in our house: The newest Apple computer, and some absurdly expensive Unix workstation on loan from his work. This set off my love of both Apple and Unix that continues to this day.

There's a nice [obituary](https://heartlandcremation.com/obituary/robert-winston-bartel/) my Aunt Susan wrote about hime if you'd like to read more about his life.
