I started boxing when I was in high school. My football coach didn't want some of us to have too much free time on our hands during the winter, and I got my ass kicked in wrestling. So, he took us to the local gym and taught us the basics. I'd go on to compete in Golden Gloves, becoming a long time member of a local gym, and continuing the practice on and off into my 30s. Despite what you'd think, I've met some of the most compassionate and empatheic people in my life in boxing gyms. It's been a big part of my life.

<br>

Since I put the gloves down, I've wanted a better way to train at home. So much so that I actually [wrote a C program](https://github.com/zackb/code/blob/master/c/callout/callout.c) to help. 

<br>

What I really wanted was someone, or something to call out punch combinations during a "round".

<br>

### Callout

<br>

So I wrote [Callout - The Boxing App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/callout-the-boxing-app/id1473350118).

<br>

The idea is pretty simple, but nothing like it exists. You select or create punch combinations to be called during a round, and iOS SpeechSythesizer does the rest. You can customize the speed, rest time, and variance of combinations called. You can even create your own combinations.

<br>

It's available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/callout-the-boxing-app/id1473350118) for free with an in-app purchase to unlock all features.
