### Mac OS X is getting worse

<br>

Update: Liquid Glass is awful.

<br>

Apple's hardware is by far the best on the market, but I feel the software has been deteriorating for some time. Gatekeeper is becoming more and more invasive, and the constant permissions dialogs are getting annoying. 

<br>

For average users It's probably all for the better, but as a developer I no longer want to use a computer I can't make software (freely) for and share with people.

<br>

In addition, I feel I've become too reliant on iCloud and some other overpriced Apple services.

<br>

I love the Mac. Some of the [most](https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/06/frequency-iphone-app/) [important](https://github.com/zackb/iOS) [software](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/zack-bartel/id1069647834) I've ever written was for Apple OSs. When Mac OS X first came out it seemed like the perfect OS. I was an Apple and Unix geek so it felt magical.

<br>

### I Love Linux

<br>

I was a Linux desktop user for many years before switching to Mac OS X in 2009. 

<br>

My [dad](/dad) and I installed a Redhat distribution with kernel version 1.1.0 around 1995, and I've been using Linux on and off ever since. As a kid, I was absolutely fascinated by the idea of open source software and the ability to modify and share code freely.

<br>

In college I worked at the [OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/), where I was introduced to [ion3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(window_manager)). I was instantly hooked on tiling window managers and used ion3 for years. This was the ultimate developer experience.


<br>

### i use arch btw

<br>

After a completely unrelated need arose to have a Linux development environment, I decided to dip my toe in the water. I bought a $300 Acer laptop and installed Arch, and Kali (I work in cybersec).

<br>

The funniest thing about the whole process is how awful the pre-loaded Windoes experience was. Their beloved OOBE experience is a joke. It took me hours to get the system into a usable state, and it was unusably slow.


<br>

Anyway, I missed ion3, tried i3 (it's not for me), and then found [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). It's amazing. I can't believe how amazing it is. It is absolutely perfect for me. I can't impress upon you enough how amazing Hyprland is.

<br>

Hyprland did take days to setup, but that's what I wanted. Although, you can get up and running in a matter of minutes, tweaking everything to be just how I wanted it took a while. And (hopefully) I'll keep improving it forever. If you don't want that there are plenty of good alternatives (xfce). 


<br>

The other thing is, this setup is **SO FAST**. Even on a budget laptop, everything is snappy and responsive.

<br>

### A non-exhaustive list of things I use

- [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) / Wayland (tiling window manager)
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) (terminal)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (for everything)
- [hypr*](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/)
    - hyprpaper
    - hypridle
    - hyprlock
- [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) (status bar)
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) (app launcher)
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)  (email - I can't find anything better)
    - aerc was pretty cool but there is way too much html email these days
- [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) (browser)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (password manager)
- [Thunar](https://thunar.org/) (file manager)
- A bunch of hacks to get iCloud CardDav and CalDav working

<br>

### Anyway,

<br>

I'm back on Linux full time now, and I couldn't be happier. It's not just for developers anymore. `time.Now().Format("2006")` is the year of the Linux desktop.
