### What is [Hyprwat](https://github.com/zackb/hyprwat/)?

<br>

[Hyprwat](https://github.com/zackb/hyprwat/) is a menu tool designed specifically for Hyprland and Wayland compositor. It allows users to create and manage customizable menus that can be accessed directly from the Hyprland environment.

<br>

It creates a popup menu at your cursor position where you can select from a list of options. It also has built-in support for WiFi network selection, audio input/output device selection, wallpapers, and custom menus. Custom menus can be defined using simple YAML configuration files.

<br>

The name is inspired by some [javascript bashing video](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) I saw many years ago. But, also like "What do you need?"... because it's a menu tool.
