### What is [Hyprwat](https://github.com/zackb/hyprwat/)?

<br>

[Hyprwat](https://github.com/zackb/hyprwat/) is a menu tool designed specifically for Hyprland and Wayland compositor. It allows users to create and manage customizable menus that can be accessed directly from the Hyprland environment.

<br>

It creates a popup menu at your cursor position where you can select from a list of options. It also has built-in support for WiFi network selection, audio input/output device selection, wallpapers, and custom menus. Custom menus can be defined using simple YAML configuration files.

<br>

The name is inspired by some [javascript bashing video](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) I saw many years ago. But, also like "What do you need?"... because it's a menu tool.

<br>

Right now you can:

1. Create a list of key / value pairs that show up in a menu, the selected value is printed to stdout.
2. Create an input menu, where the user can type in a value that is printed to stdout.
3. Create password menu, where the user can type in a masked value that is printed to stdout.
4. Select from available WiFi networks (dbus + NetworkManager).
5. Select audio input/output devices (pipewire).
6. Select wallpaper (hyprpaper).
7. Create custom menus with a bunch of GUI controls using YAML configuration files.

### What does it look like?

<br>

Integrate with powerprofilesctl to switch power profiles:

<br>

Change wallpapers and lock the screen:

Connect to wifi networks:

<br>

### Why?

<br>

I created hyprwat to fill a gap in the Wayland ecosystem for a simple, flexible, and visually appealing menu system that can be easily integrated into various use cases. Particularly, for waybar I needed a menu selection for wifi networks, power profiles, pavcontrol, etc.

<br>

Then, I wanted an easier way to switch wallpapers and lock the screen and found the existing solutions too hard, so I just added it into hyprwat. I'll keep doing this, it's fun.

<br>

[My first attempt](https://github.com/zackb/code/tree/master/cpp/wat) used SDL2/3 and ImGui, but I didn't like the menu being a window (there's no layer shell support in SDL). So I rewrote it using pure Wayland protocols and EGL for rendering.

<br>

If nothing else it's a pretty [cool cpp wrapper for Wayland protocols](https://github.com/zackb/hyprwat/tree/main/src/wayland).
