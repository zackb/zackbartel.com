### [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) is my favorite programming language.

<br>

It always has been and probably always will be. It allowed me to build cool stuff at a young age, create iOS and Mac software (via Objective-C), contribute to the Linux kernel, and work on embedded systems on airplanes.

<br>

When I first learned C++ in college, it was great. It was like having a super-charged version of C. Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, it felt modern and powerful.

<br>

I last used C++ heavily around 2010. At that time the [Template Metapocalypse](https://learncodethehardway.com/blog/31-c-plus-plus-is-an-absolute-blast#the-c-template-metapocalypse) was in full swing. That experience made me not like programming.

<br>

I was tired of dealing with the complexities. The syntax was verbose, error messages unusable, build systems a nightmare, and the community divided over best practices. I moved on to other languages: Go, Java/Scala, Swift, Python, Javascript, but I would often miss the power of C++.

<br>

Whenever I had to use JNI or some other [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) (Foreign Function Interface), I felt weak. I don't want to have to wait for some third-party library to bind to my favorite language. I want to write high-performance code directly.

<br>

C++11 was on the horizon, promising to fix many of the issues, but the complexity of the language had already scared off many developers.

<br>

I took a long break from C++.
