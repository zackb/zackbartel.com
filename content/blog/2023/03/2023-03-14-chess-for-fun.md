### I've played chess off and on since I was a kid ###
I remember the excitement of learning the rules, beating my dad (he let me win), the thrill of my first rated victory, and the countless hours spent poring over strategies and tactics. Over the years, I reached a respectable level of play, competing in local tournaments and climbing the ranks.

<br>

However, as time went on, I found myself increasingly frustrated. The more I studied and practiced, the more I realized how much there was to learn. Chess is a game of infinite complexity, and no matter how hard I tried, I felt like I was hitting a ceiling. My progress slowed to a crawl, and the joy I once found in the game began to wane. What was really the kicker was when I hit an all-time high rating of 1895 (chess.com) and then promptly dropped back down to 1700 within a few weeks. It was disheartening to see my hard work seemingly unravel and never quite reach the heights I once had.

<br>

I was spending nights and weekends reading books, doing tactics puzzles, and analyzing games, but it felt like I was running in place. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I didn't know. It was a humbling experience, but also a frustrating one. I began to question whether the time and effort I was putting into chess was worth it. 

<br>

Games weren't fun anymore; they felt like chores. I found myself dreading the start of a game, which used to be adrenaline filled excitement. The pressure to improve and perform well was taking the joy out of the game. I started to see chess as a source of stress rather than a source of enjoyment.

<br>

### Then, one night I said "fuck it" ###
and decided to just blitz out a bunch of games. It made me realize that chess was supposed to be fun, not a source of frustration. I'm never going to be a grandmaster and I don't have to feel like I should aspire to that. I started playing for the sheer enjoyment of the game, without worrying about my rating or performance. I played casual games with friends, tried tricky and trappy gambits online, and simply enjoyed the process of playing. The thrill of finding a brilliancy, laughing at silly blunders that lost me games. I can't understate how upset I would typically get if I made a mistake and/or lost a game.

<br>

This realization reinvigorated my play. I once again look forward to starting a game, tough situations in the mid-game, king-and-pawn endgames. The joy for the game returned! I know I will probably not improve my rating much for the remainder of my playing days, but I really don't care. What I care about is being in a community of people who love the game as much as I do, and enjoying the process of playing. Chess is a beautiful game, and I'm grateful to have it in my life, even if I'm not the best player out there.
