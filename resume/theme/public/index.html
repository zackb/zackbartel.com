            <strong>Co-Founder</strong>
            <p>2011 - 2014</p>
            <p>Following Google’s CDN for jQuery, we decided to start a CDN for the less popular Javascript frameworks. The CDN is community moderated and open source on GitHub. We secured a partnership with Cloudflare.com who now supports the infrastructure.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hundreds of thousands of sites use the cdn in production</li>
              <li>Larger market share than Yahoo&#39;s and Microsoft&#39;s content distribution network</li>
              <li>We serve tens of billions request a month</li>
              <li>Contains over 800 popular Javascript libraries</li>
              <li>Hundreds of thousands developers visit the site per year</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Started off as a front end developer but took on the role of CTO in early 2013. Managed a large Rails application and did a big server and database(MongoDB) migration from Heroku to Amazon.</p>
            <ul>

            <strong>Developer</strong>
            <p>2014 - 2014</p>
            <p>Hired to take EFF&#39;s campaigning to the next level by building an action centre in Ruby on Rails. The action centre is built around some large open source tools that lower the barrier to entry when contacting congress.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed new tools for contacting congress</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Developer</strong>
            <p>2014 - 2014</p>
            <p>Worked on many politically charged campaigns against mass surveillance. Our latest project was &quot;TheDayWeFightBack&quot; and I worked on all areas of it. The campaign resulted in 37,000,000 banner views, 100,000 phone calls, ~500,000 emails and ~250,000 signatures. I work mostly in the frontend and also running the Heroku servers which are cached by Cloudfront.</p>
