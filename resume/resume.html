        <p>I&#39;m a full stack developer blended with experience building and shipping iOS, Android, and TV applications. Over the years I have absorbed technologies and systems making me a capable generalist. I love to learn, and will continue to gain as much knowledge as I possibly can. When not behind a computer for work or for fun, I teach boxing to kids and adults, test my culinary skills, and fumble around with a guitar.</p>

            <p>Zack is always a huge asset to the company he works for. I worked with Zack at Tectura and then at GetBack and at both companies, he was always fun to work with. His ability to quickly solve problems and to push through difficult tasks makes him invaluable when it comes to staying on schedule and delivering a product. Zack has a wide range of interests that carry over into his work. He knows how to manage servers, he knows how to set up and configure development infrastructure (e.g. revision control, bug tracking, etc), he knows how to design, document and write code, and he knows how to test and deliver the final product. I hope I get a chance to work with Zack again in the future. -

            <p>I can&#39;t imagine how any team could have a more enthusiastic, dedicated and capable team member than Zack. Zack is always the first to volunteer for any complicated task, and he always completes that task quickly with aplomb and elegant simplicity. He is a joy to work with, witty and efficient in a way that makes everything he does seem effortless, no matter how complicated it may be. He is the first person we turn to when a problem seems insurmountable, and he always delivers. My experience with Zack has been with him in Portland and me in Los Angeles, and it always seems as though he is right there at my side, with frequently instantaneous response. If you are looking for someone who is totally responsive; creative in his approach; dedicated to the simplest, most elegant solution and highly informed as to the best practices in front-end and back-end solutions, Zack is your guy. Humble, soft-spoken and genial, his laid-back persona masks a powerful intellect. -

            <p>Reported to and worked directly with Zack at GetBack Media, Inc. A talented and experienced software engineer, Zack was able to see all sides of a problem that faced him. He worked extremely well under high-pressure situations, dealing with the dilemma with a calm and collected attitude, and was able to resolve the issues that he faced very quickly and efficiently. Zack is a great communicator and was very enjoyable and a pleasure to work with. -
